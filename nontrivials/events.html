<!-- event is automatically passed when an event occures in a web interaction -->
<!-- Events can be triggered by user actions (like clicking a button, submitting a
    form, hovering over an element, etc.). /* Properties and Methods of the Event
    Object: 1=>e.target: This property references the element that triggered the
    event. For example, if you click a button, e.target will refer to that button.
    2=>e.type: Indicates the type of event that occurred, such as "click," "submit,"
"mouseover," etc. e.preventDefault(): A method used to prevent the default
behavior associated with an event. For instance, preventing a form from
submitting or a link from navigating to a new page. e.stopPropagation():
Prevents the event from propagating up or down the DOM tree. It stops event
bubbling or capturing. e.clientX and e.clientY: These properties provide the
horizontal and vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer when the event
occurred, particularly useful for mouse-related events. e.key and e.keyCode:
These properties provide information about keys pressed during keyboard-related
events. */
